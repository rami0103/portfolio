Reflection:

    Making the web portfolio brought together all the skills and learning I have acquired through my work in Web Development I, II and UX Design. 

    It also reinforced my knowledge and skills when it comes to Bootstrap, although admittedly more practice is definitely needed. 
    
    In my opinion, creating the mock-ups, logo and other digital assets in my portfolio improved my digital graphics and design. Creating a site-map on paper and digital wireframes and prototypes enabled me to make this with clear and simple navigation. It also sped up the coding part of the assignment because I alredy made the decisions on the style guide and did not have to make it up as I go.
